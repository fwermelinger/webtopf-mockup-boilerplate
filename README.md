# webtopf-mockup-boilerplate
A boilerplate repository for quickly getting started creating html and css mockups. Uses jQuery, Bootstrap, SASS and Gulp. 

## Get started
run `npm install` to install all dependencies

run `gulp` to build the *dist* folder that contains the generated css and js files

run `gulp watch` to start a local browserSync development server at `http://localhost:3000` for development

BrowserSync will take care of automatically refreshing all resources in the browser while you edit them.
